# Welcome

This is a page created so Loudbook could give his amazing advice without a robot named "Anna" interrupting him.

All of these guides were made by one person, so take everything with a grain of salt. If you have any questions, you can ask. Below I have listed some good communities to ask questions in.

## Communities
- [Minecraft Discord](https://discord.gg/minecraft) - The official Minecraft Discord server.
- [Minecraft Community Support Discord](https://discord.gg/58Sxm23) - A community support server for Minecraft.
