# Hosting a PaperMC Server
This guide will show you how to create a PaperMC server. PaperMC is a high-performance fork of Spigot that aims to fix bugs and improve performance. It's a great choice for servers that want to plugins, however PaperMC will consume significantly more resources than Vanilla Minecraft.

## Requirements
- A computer that will be on when you or your friends want to play
- A good internet connection
- A basic understanding of networking
- At least 5GB of RAM free at all times

## Steps
1. Download the server software from the [official website](https://papermc.io/downloads).
2. Create a new folder on your computer and place the server software in it.
3. Install [Java 21](/installing-java) on your computer.
4. Double click on the server software to run it. This will create some files in the folder.
5. Open the `eula.txt` file and change `eula=false` to `eula=true`.
6. Double click on the server software again to run it. This will start the server.
7. Share your IP address with your friends. You can find your IP address by searching "what is my IP" on Google.
8. Have your friends open Minecraft and click on "Multiplayer". Then click on "Add Server" and enter your IP address.
