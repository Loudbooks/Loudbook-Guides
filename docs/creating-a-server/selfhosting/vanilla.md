# Hosting a Vanilla Server
No mods, no plugins, just pure Minecraft. This is the simplest type of server to create, and it's perfect for those who want to play Minecraft with friends without any extra features.

## Requirements
- A computer that will be on when you or your friends want to play
- A good internet connection
- A basic understanding of networking

## Steps
1. Download the server software from the [official website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server).
2. Create a new folder on your computer and place the server software in it.
3. Install [Java 21](/installing-java) on your computer.
4. Double click on the server software to run it. This will create some files in the folder.
5. Open the `eula.txt` file and change `eula=false` to `eula=true`.
6. Double click on the server software again to run it. This will start the server.
7. Share your IP address with your friends. You can find your IP address by searching "what is my IP" on Google.
8. Have your friends open Minecraft and click on "Multiplayer". Then click on "Add Server" and enter your IP address.

In order for people outside your network to connect to your server, you will need to port forward your router. You can find a guide on how to do this [here](https://portforward.com/how-to-port-forward/).

By default, you will need to port forward `25565`.
